## About Us / Links
Founded in 1964, Condor has connected the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey with the UK and France (in addition to a short-lived link with Sark). In 2025, MillsJ09 founded Condor Ferries Roblox with the aim to become the most realistic operator in the ro-maritime space. Our team has over 16 years of travel experience with Condor Roblox in addition to real staff members.
